# Tattler API Project - v1.0.0

## Project Description

This repository contains the backend infrastructure for the Tattler project, a modern and sustainable restaurant directory. The goal is to build a robust and scalable backend using MongoDB for the database and a RESTful API with Express.js.

This initial version (v1.0.0) corresponds to Sprint 1, which includes the database setup, data import scripts, and the initial database backup.

## Repository Structure

- `/backup/`: Contains the database backup files generated by `mongodump`.
- `/data/`: Contains the initial data in `.csv` format.
- `/scripts/`: Contains the scripts needed to import data into the database.
- `/screenshots/`: Contains screenshots of the database and collections as evidence of creation.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the database on your local machine, you will need to have **MongoDB Community Server** installed and running.

Once MongoDB is ready, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `/scripts` directory inside the project folder.
3.  Run the import script with the following command:
    ```bash
    sh import.sh
    ```
4.  This will create the `tattler_db` database and the `restaurants` collection, populating it with the data from the `.csv` file.

## Usage

Currently, the project only contains the database infrastructure. The RESTful API for interacting with this data will be developed in Sprints 2 and 3.
